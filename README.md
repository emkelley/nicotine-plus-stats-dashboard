# Stats Dashboard

This is just a simple dashboard page that consumes the `stats.json` file created by the more-upload-stats plugin for [Nicotine+](https://nicotine-plus.org/). Purely created out of frustration with the plugin's dashboard never working for me.


## Usage

1. Install the [`more-upload-stats`](https://github.com/Nachtalb/more-upload-stats) plugin for Nicotine+
2. Wait for people to download music from you
3. Open `dashboard.html`, this does _not_ need to be serverd by a server
4. Open the newly generated `stats.json` from the dashboard
5. Enjoy your stats
